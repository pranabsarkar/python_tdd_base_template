# python_tdd_base_template

## Overview

This is a simple Python Based Template, where we can leverage the benfits of test driven development without any infrastucture dependency and follow the `PEP-8` standard.

## Steps - Involved

1. We have to write their code in the `src` directory with their testcases inside the `tests` directory.

2. The request/responce for the respective python module should be maintained inside the `tests/fixtures` directory in `.json` format.

3. We can check their code by executing `python app.py` inside their terminal/command prompt.

If there is any error/warning in their code, we can watch the details inside the terminal/command prompt as shown in the picture above and fix accordingly

## Setup Guide
